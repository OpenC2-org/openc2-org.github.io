JSON Abstract Data Notation (JADN) is a UML-based information
modeling language that defines data structure independently of
data format. Information models are used to define and generate
physical data models, validate information instances, and enable
lossless translation across data formats. A JADN specification
consists of two parts: type definitions that comprise the
information model, and serialization rules that define how
information instances are represented as data.
