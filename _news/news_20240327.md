OASIS has announced the 
[public review](https://www.oasis-open.org/2025/03/27/openc2-json-abstract-data-notation-jadn-version-2-0-csd01-available-for-comment/)
of the OpenC2 TC's *JSON Abstract Data Notation (JADN)* Version 2.0 (CSD01). Version 2 of
this specification is a refinement of the original
[JADN Specification](https://docs.oasis-open.org/openc2/jadn/v1.0/jadn-v1.0.html) with a collection of updates that include:

- adding inheritance features
- refining and expanding the type and field options, including new formatting options
- increasing the flexibility of namespace and package management in the creation of
information models, and
- adding XML serialization rules

A detailed change list can be found in [Appendix D](https://docs.oasis-open.org/openc2/jadn/v2.0/jadn-v2.0.html#changes-from-v10-to-v20) of the new specification.

The public review of CSD01 is open until **28 April 2028**.

The companion *Information Modeling with JADN* Committee Note is being updated
to align with the version 2 JADN Specification. The latest version of the CN is
[v1.0, CN03 (19 February 2025)](https://docs.oasis-open.org/openc2/imjadn/v1.0/cn03/imjadn-v1.0-cn03.html).
Work continues to update the CN to v2.0 that will fully align with the updated JADN
specification. The current status of the CN can be found in its [GitHub repo's
working branch](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/openc2-jadn-im/tree/working).
