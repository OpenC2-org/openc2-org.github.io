OpenC2 TC members participated in the first preparation session (December 6th) for a planned 
[April 2024 Cybersecurity Automation Village (CAV)](https://github.com/opencybersecurityalliance/casp/tree/main/Plugfests/2024-03-NorthernVirginia)
event. A [test matrix](https://github.com/opencybersecurityalliance/casp/blob/main/Plugfests/2024-03-NorthernVirginia/test-matrix-2024-03.md)
is being developed to document participants' planned contributions and
facilitate identifying opportunities to demonstrate interoperability. A second
preparation session is planned for early March 2024, and the
Village will be held April 11-12 at Peraton's offices at 1875 Explorer St, Reston, VA 20190.

The [CASP GitHub repository](https://github.com/opencybersecurityalliance/casp)
contains detailed information and is the place to sign up to participate and
contribute to the Village. The [CASP mailing
list](https://lists.oasis-open-projects.org/g/oca-casp/topics) is also a
coordination resource.
