OpenC2 transfer specifications describe how to use standard
protocols to transfer OpenC2 messages. The HTTPS Transfer
Specification describes how to use HTTP and TLS in support of
OpenC2 messaging. The v1.1 update incorporates an updated OpenC2

addition of a well-known path for POSTing OpenC2 commands, and
other minor changes and corrections.
