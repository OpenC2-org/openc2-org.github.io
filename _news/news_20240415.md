OpenC2 TC member organizations participated in the [11-12 April 2024
Cybersecurity Automation Village](https://github.com/opencybersecurityalliance/casp/tree/main/Plugfests/2024-03-NorthernVirginia).
The Village, sponsored by the [Open Cybersecurity Alliance](https://opencybersecurityalliance.org/) Cybersecurity Automation
Subproject ([CASP](https://opencybersecurityalliance.org/casp/)), addressed
sharing information, prototyping, testing, and specifying interoperability among
cybersecurity automation technologies.  
  
OpenC2 participated in use cases involving the
[Kestrel](https://github.com/opencybersecurityalliance/kestrel-lang) Threat
Hunting Language and
[CACAO-based](https://groups.oasis-open.org/communities/tc-community-home2?CommunityKey=b75cccb8-adc6-4de5-8b99-018dc7d322b6)
automation.

and
[HII](https://github.com/opencybersecurityalliance/casp/tree/main/Plugfests/2024-03-NorthernVirginia/SweatEquity/HII)
focused on the [OpenC2 Threat Hunting AP](https://docs.oasis-open.org/openc2/ap-hunt/v1.0/csd02/ap-hunt-v1.0-csd02.html)
and were supported by a CACAO playbook that illustrated invoking a sequence of huntflows developed for the demonstration.
