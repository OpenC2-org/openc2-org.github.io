TC member [Vasileios Mavroeidis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vasileiosmavroeidis/) will be presenting on OpenC2 at the
[SecOps2024](https://blackcell.io/secops-24/) International Exercise &
Conference on Security Operations. This event takes place February 15, 2024 in
Budapest, Hungary.

**Title:** _Do away with siloed cybersecurity operations and customized integrations._

**Description:**  As the number of vulnerable channels continues to grow, there is
also an increase in the deployment of security solutions. This highlights the
importance of interconnecting an organization's cybersecurity solutions to
ensure ongoing and effective threat management. However, integrations are costly
to develop and maintain and heavily rely on proprietary communication interfaces
that require reconfiguring parts or the entire defense ecosystem of the
organization when tools are introduced or replaced or when there are updates to
the APIs utilized. This presentation will discuss OASIS Open Command and Control
(OpenC2), a standardized machine-to-machine language for the command and control
of cyber defense technologies, allowing them to interoperate without needing
customized integrations.
