The Language Specification is the foundation document defining
the OpenC2 language. The TC has determined to advance the
Language Specification to Version 2.0 to address changes
identified since the November 2019 publication of v1.0, CSD02,
including a small number of breaking changes. CSD01 is the initial
publication of the in-development v.0 specification.
