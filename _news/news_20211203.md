HTTP over TLS is a widely deployed transfer protocol that
provides authenticated, ordered, lossless delivery of
uniquely-identified messages. This document specifies the use of
HTTP over TLS as a transfer mechanism for OpenC2 Messages. This
specification replaces the July 2019 v.10 CS01, and incorporates
changes to OpenC2 message formatting and other lessons learned
through interoperability testing.  A Testing conformance target
is provided to support interoperability testing without security
mechanisms.
