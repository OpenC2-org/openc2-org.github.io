OASIS has published Committee Specification Draft 02 of <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"

This CSD was approved for publication by the OpenC2 TC. The Threat Hunting AP
defines the OpenC2 Actions, Targets, Arguments, and Specifiers along with
conformance clauses to enable the operation of OpenC2 Producers and Consumers in
the context of cyber threat hunting. It covers the identification and invocation
of stored hunting processes (e.g., “hunt flows”), passing of hunt parameters,
and the expected type(s) and format(s) of information returned by hunting
processes.
