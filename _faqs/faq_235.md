question: How does OpenC2 relate to the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP)?
---

The [Security Content Automation Protocol
(SCAP)](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/security-content-automation-protocol)
is "a method for using specific standards to enable automated
vulnerability management, measurement, and policy compliance
evaluation of systems deployed in an organization"
([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Content_Automation_Protocol)).
The SCAP program is managed by the US [National Institute of
Standards and Technology (NIST)](https://www.nist.gov/) as part
of that organization's broader security automation efforts. The
initial set of SCAP standards were published in 2009. Security
automation mechanisms could, for example, use OpenC2 commands to
manage remediation of cybersecurity issues uncovered through
SCAP.
