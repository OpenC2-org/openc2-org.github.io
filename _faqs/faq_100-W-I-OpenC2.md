question: What is OpenC2?
---

OpenC2 is a standardized language for machine-to-machine
communications for the command and control of technologies that
provide or support cyber defenses. The [OpenC2 Technical
Committee](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=openc2)
is developing a suite of specifications that define the OpenC2
architecture, language, tailor its use to specific cyber-defense
functions, and specify how to convey OpenC2 messages using
various industry-standard transfer protocols.
