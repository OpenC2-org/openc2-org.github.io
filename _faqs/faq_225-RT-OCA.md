question: How does OpenC2 relate to the Open Cybersecurity Alliance (OCA)?
---

The [Open Cybersecurity Alliance
(OCA)](https://opencybersecurityalliance.org/) is an OASIS [Open
Project](https://www.oasis-open.org/open-projects/) focused on
building "an open ecosystem where cybersecurity products
interoperate without the need for custom integrations". OpenC2 is
being used on the OCA
[PACE](https://opencybersecurityalliance.org/pace/) sub-project
as the preferred C2 mechanism, and development has started on a
threat hunting AP for OpenC2 to invoke OCA's
[Kestrel](https://github.com/opencybersecurityalliance/kestrel-lang)
language. OpenC2 TC member organizations also participate in the [Cybersecurity Automation Sub-Project
(CASP)](https://opencybersecurityalliance.org/casp/).
