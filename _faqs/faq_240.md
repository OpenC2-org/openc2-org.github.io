question: How does OpenC2 relate to the OCA Ontology?
---

The Open Cybersecurity Alliance's [OCA
Ontology](https://github.com/opencybersecurityalliance/oca-ontology)
(formerly known as the OCA OpenDXL Ontology) is "an effort to
bring semantic consistency to the full spectrum of enterprise
cyber security." Creating a common vernacular among different
vendors and cybersecurity sub-disciplines, and establishing
"formal, machine-readable representations" are means to improve
interoperability, which OpenC2 should be able to leverage.
