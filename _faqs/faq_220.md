question: How does OpenC2 relate to OpenDXL?
---

[OpenDXL](https://www.opendxl.com/) is an initiative to create
adaptive systems of interconnected services that communicate and
share information for real-time, accurate security decisions and
actions. As a communications fabric, OpenDXL supports both
point-to-point and publish / subscribe communications models.
OpenDXL could be used as a communications fabric for OpenC2, but
no transfer specification has been formalized for it.
