question: How does OpenC2 relate to NIEM?
---

[NIEM](https://www.niem.gov/), originally launched in 2005, is "a
common vocabulary that enables efficient information exchange
across diverse public and private organizations", and as of early
2023 has
[shifted](https://www.niem.gov/about-niem/news/niem-new-open-project-18-years-making)
from being a government-driven activity to an [OASIS Open
Project](https://www.oasis-open.org/open-projects/). 

The OpenC2 community has engaged with the NIEM Open Project
regarding the potential to apply the [JADN information modeling
language](https://docs.oasis-open.org/openc2/jadn/v1.0/cs01/jadn-v1.0-cs01.html)
to the evolution of NIEM.
