question: How does OpenC2 relate to OCSF?
---

The [Open Cybersecurity Schema Framework
(OCSF)](https://github.com/ocsf), originally [announced during
BlackHat USA
2022](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tonybradley/2022/08/10/coalition-of-cybersecurity-leaders-launch-open-cybersecurity-schema-framework-ocsf/?sh=3f8e0d291f7d)
is "an open-source project, delivering an extensible framework
for developing schemas, along with a vendor-agnostic core
security schema. ... The goal is to provide an open standard,
adopted in any environment, application, or solution, while
complementing existing security standards and processes."

The OpenC2 community has engaged with the OCSF project regarding
the potential to apply the [JADN information modeling
language](https://docs.oasis-open.org/openc2/jadn/v1.0/cs01/jadn-v1.0-cs01.html)
to the evolution of OCSF.
