question: How does OpenC2 relate to the OASIS CACAO TC?
---

The [CACAO (Collaborative Automated Course of Action Operations
for Cyber Security)
TC's](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=cacao)
goal is defining the standard for creating machine-readable
course of action playbooks for cybersecurity operations. CACAO
will have the ability of integrating different languages for
controlling components that are part of cyber defense ecosystems,
thus, OpenC2 is a candidate.
