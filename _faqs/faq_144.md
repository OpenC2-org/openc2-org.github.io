question: How can I learn more about JADN?  
---

A brief introduction to JADN can be found in the [*JADN and
OpenC2*](JADN-and-OpenC2.md) document in the TC's [operations
repository](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/openc2-tc-ops). The TC
is developing a [Committee Note
(CN)](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/oasis-defined-terms-2018-05-22/#dCommitteeNote)
on [*Information Modeling Using
JADN*](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/openc2-jadn-im/blob/working/imjadn-v1.0-cn01.md)
(the link is to the in-progress draft, which is substantially
complete). The CN provides an overview of information modeling
and the use of JADN for that purpose. Detailed specifics can be
found in the [*Specification for JSON Abstract Data Notation
(JADN)*](https://docs.oasis-open.org/openc2/jadn/v1.0/cs01/jadn-v1.0-cs01.html),
an OASIS [Committee Specification
(CS)](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/oasis-defined-terms-2018-05-22/#dCommitteeSpec)
published in August 2021.
