question: Are there tools for working with JADN?
---

Open source tools to process JADN information models (abstract
schemas) used to define OpenC2 content as well as other types of
structured data, e.g., Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)
documents and validate data against an information model can be
found on Github in an OASIS TC Open Repository of [JADN
Software](https://github.com/oasis-open/openc2-jadn-software).
