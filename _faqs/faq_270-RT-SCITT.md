question: How does OpenC2 relate to IETF SCITT?
---

The IETF [Supply Chain Integrity, Transparency, and Trust (SCITT)
working group](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/scitt/about/) is
"defin[ing] a set of interoperable building blocks that will
allow implementers to build integrity and accountability into
software supply chain systems to help assure trustworthy
operation." The group is working on [multiple
documnents](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/scitt/documents/),
including [an
architecture](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-scitt-architecture/).

At present there is no defined relationship between OpenC2 and
SCITT, but the open nature of both provides opportunities where
OpenC2-based interactions could be used in SCITT implementations.
