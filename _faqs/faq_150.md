question: Do I have to be a member of OASIS to use OpenC2?
---

No, OASIS OpenC2 specifications are available to all. There are
no known intellectual property rights associated with OpenC2. See
[this page](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/openc2/ipr.php)
for additional information.

If you desire to participate in the OpenC2 Technical Committee
and draft future specifications, then OASIS membership would be
required.
