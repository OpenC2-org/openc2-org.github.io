question: Is there an OpenC2 API?
---

The OpenC2 Language Specification and Actuator Profiles taken
together define the request and response message content and
expected actions, and a Transfer Specification defines the
communications method. The exchange of OpenC2 command and
response messages using the [HTTPS Transfer
Specification](https://docs.oasis-open.org/openc2/open-impl-https/v1.0/open-impl-https-v1.0.html)
can be considered a Remote Procedure Call (RPC)-style Web API.
OpenC2 does not have a Web API defined in terms of
Representational State Transfer (REST).
