question: How does OpenC2 relate to Manufacturer Usage Descriptions (MUD)?
---

[Manufacturer Usage Descriptions
(MUD)](https://developer.cisco.com/docs/mud/#!what-is-mud) is an
embedded software standard defined by the IETF that allows IoT
Device makers to advertise device specifications, including the
intended communication patterns for their device when it connects
to the network. The network can then use this intent to author a
context-specific access policy, so the device functions only
within those parameters. In this manner, MUD becomes the
authoritative identifier and enforcer of policy for devices on
the network. MUD is defined in [RFC
8520](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8520).
