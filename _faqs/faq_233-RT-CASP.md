question: How does OpenC2 relate to CASP?
---

The [Cybersecrity Automation Sub-Project
(CASP)](https://opencybersecurityalliance.org/casp/) is an [Open
Cybersecurity Alliance](https://opencybersecurityalliance.org/)
effort to bring together like-minded cybersecurity vendors, end
users, thought leaders and individuals who are interested in
cybersecurity automation.  It is a forum to exchange information,
insights, and reference implementations via commonly developed
code and tooling, using mutually agreed upon technologies,
specifications, and procedures. OpenC2 TC members participate in
CASP, including 
[plugfest events](https://github.com/opencybersecurityalliance/casp/tree/main/Plugfests)
where members can test, enhance, and demonstrate interoperability
among cybersecurity automation tools.
