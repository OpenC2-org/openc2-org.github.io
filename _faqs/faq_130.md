question: What can OpenC2 do for me?
---

As cyber-defense technology vendors and providers adopt OpenC2,
OpenC2 can dramatically improve incident response to
cyber-threats and allow for enterprise wide interoperability for
cyber-security policy orchestration. Management and development
of cyber-defense responses is simplified and greater
collaboration and integration across a wide range of technologies
is enabled.
