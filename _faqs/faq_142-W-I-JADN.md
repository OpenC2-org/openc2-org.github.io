question: What is JADN?
---

[JSON Abstract Data Notation
(JADN)](https://docs.oasis-open.org/openc2/jadn/v1.0/cs01/jadn-v1.0-cs01.html)
is a UML-based information modeling language that defines
information requirements and data structure independently of data
format. JADN was created by the OpenC2 TC to assist with defining
 OpenC2 information models for the language and actuator profiles
in a way that supports the language's goal of enabling
machine-to-machine communications for purposes of command and
control of cyber defense components, subsystems and/or systems in
a manner that is agnostic of the serialization formats.
