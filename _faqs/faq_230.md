question: How does OpenC2 relate to PACE?
---

Posture Attribute Collection and Evaluation ([PACE](https://opencybersecurityalliance.org/pace/)) is an
[Open Cybersecurity Alliance](https://opencybersecurityalliance.org/)
effort to create a
comprehensive automated strategy for understanding security posture.
OpenC2 plays two roles in PACE.
PACE uses OpenC2 for command & control to obtain security posture information,
and for the command & control of the PACE system itself
(e.g., request security posture evaluation of a device).
OpenC2 also plays a role in implementing the actions
that result from posture evaluation
(e.g., add a firewall rule, sandbox a device, etc).
