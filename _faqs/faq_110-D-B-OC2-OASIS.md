question: What is the difference between OpenC2 and OASIS?
---

[OpenC2](https://groups.oasis-open.org/communities/tc-community-home2?CommunityKey=a34c9baf-48b2-44c5-a567-018dc7d32296)
is an open source language, available for use and input across
the cyber-security community. Many open source languages and
technologies benefit from support of standards bodies, to help
guide and champion on-going use and evolution of the software or
technology. OpenC2 is a project under
[OASIS](https://www.oasis-open.org/). OASIS is the
**O**rganization for the **A**dvancement of **S**tructured
**I**nformation **S**tandards, a nonprofit international
consortium that develops open IT standards.
