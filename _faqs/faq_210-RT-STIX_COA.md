question: How does OpenC2 relate to STIX Course of Action (COA)?
---

[Structured Threat Information Expression
(STIXâ„¢)](https://oasis-open.github.io/cti-documentation/) is a
language and serialization format used to exchange cyber threat
intelligence (CTI). One of the STIX Domain Objects (SDOs),
[Course of Action
(COA)](https://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/stix/v2.1/os/stix-v2.1-os.html#_a925mpw39txn),
has the ability to capture structured/automated courses of
action. OpenC2 can be utilized to populate STIX COA SDOs for
sharing automated courses of action for the purpose of responding
to cyber incidents in cyber-relevant time.
