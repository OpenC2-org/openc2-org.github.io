question: How does OpenC2 relate to Kestrel?
---

[Kestrel](https://github.com/opencybersecurityalliance/kestrel-lang)
is an [Open Cybersecurity Alliance](https://opencybersecurityalliance.org/) effort to create a threat hunting language that enables building reusable,
composable, and shareable huntflows across different data sources
and threat intel. Kestrel comprises a threat hunting language for
a human to express *what* to hunt, and a runtime machine
interpreter that deals with *how* to hunt. OpenC2 is
collaborating with the Kestrel team to define an [OpenC2 AP for
Threat Hunting](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/openc2-ap-hunt/tree/working) to automate the invocation of threat hunting activities,
based on the threat hunting concepts embodied in Kestrel.
