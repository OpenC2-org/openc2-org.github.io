          technical artifacts</a> are housed in GitHub.

        <p>
          You can also get involved in the OASIS OpenC2 technical
          committee to contribute to the on-going development and
          evolution of the standards. OpenC2 is documented using
          three types of documents.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><em>Overarching documents:</em> describe the broad
          capabilities of OpenC2 and the approach to using it.
          These are the Language Specification (published as
          OASIS Committee Specification) and the OpenC2
          Architecture (work-in-progress).</li>
          <li><em>Actuator Profiles:</em>  these map the OpenC2
          language to the capabilities associated with specific
          cyber-defense functions. One has been published as an
          OASIS Committee Specification and several more are in
          development. </li>
          <li><em>Transfer Specifications:</em>  these document
          how OpenC2 messages are moved between Producers and
          Consumers using industry-standard protocols. One has
          been published as an OASIS Committee Specification and
          several more are in development. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          When the OpenC2 TC was established, three subcommittees
          were created to develop the three types of documents.
          The TC has now consolidated its process to a combined
          weekly working meeting, but information about the
          subcommittees is available at OASIS to preserver the
          history:
