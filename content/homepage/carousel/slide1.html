<h2 class="animate__animated animate__fadeInDown">Welcome to OpenC2</h2>
<p class="animate__animated animate__fadeInUp">OpenC2 is a standardized language for the command and control of technologies that provide or support cyber defenses.  By providing a common language for machine-to-machine communication, OpenC2 is vendor and application agnostic, enabling interoperability across a range of cyber security tools and applications.  The use of standardized interfaces and protocols enables interoperability of different tools, regardless of the vendor that developed them, the language they are written in or the function they are designed to fulfill.</p>
