OpenC2 defines a language at a level of abstraction that will enable unambiguous command and control of cyber defense technologies. OpenC2 is broad enough to provide flexibility in the implementation of devices and accommodate future products and will have the precision necessary to achieve the desired effect. As an Open Source initiative, the community of cyber-security stakeholders across government agencies, small to large industries across all sectors, and academia can join together to innovate and evolve this cyberdefense approach.
