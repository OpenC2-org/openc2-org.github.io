Today, cyber defense technologies, systems and applications often use
proprietary software and commands to control system configurations. Most
environments within a company or enterprise are comprised of hundreds of
different types of cyber-defense devices. This highlights the
importance of interconnecting an organization's cybersecurity solutions to
ensure ongoing and effective threat management.

When security incidents are detected or configuration changes are required,
manual commands and real time system updates are required, increasing incident
response time and potentially introducing human error.
