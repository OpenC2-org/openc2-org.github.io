_Integrations reduce the level of manual efforts but  are costly to develop and
maintain and rely heavily on proprietary communication interfaces. This requires
reconfiguring parts or the entire defense ecosystem of the organization when
tools are introduced or replaced or when there are updates to the APIs
utilized._ Through OpenC2 and the use of standardized interfaces and protocols,
interoperability across tools, vendors, technologies and programming languages
is achieved.

Security professionals can orchestrate automated, tactical threat responses
across a wide range of cyber-defense technologies at speeds significantly
greater than previously imagined.
